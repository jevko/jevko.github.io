# Jevko: minimal syntax

**Jevko** is a minimal general-purpose syntax.

It can be used as a basic building block for simple and portable formats, languages, and notations in a variety of domains, such as data interchange, configuration, or text markup.

For example a data interchange format built on Jevko looks like this:

```
first name [John]
last name [Smith]
is alive [true]
age [27]
address [
  street address [21 2nd Street]
  city [New York]
  state [NY]
  postal code [10021-3100]
]
phone numbers [
  [
    type [home]
    number [212 555-1234]
  ]
  [
    type [office]
    number [646 555-4567]
  ]
]
children []
spouse []
```
